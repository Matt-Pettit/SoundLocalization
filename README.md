# Acoustic Signal Triangulation System 🔊📡
This repository contains the code, simulations, and documentation for an acoustic signal triangulation system designed to locate the position of a sound source within an A1 rectangular grid. The system utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) techniques and consists of four microphone breakout boards, two Raspberry Pi microcontrollers, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying results. 

## 🔥 Features
- Audio Signal Capture and Processing: The system captures and processes audio signals from the microphones, ensuring synchronized sampling and accurate time-stamping. 
- Time Delay Computation: Algorithms are implemented to calculate the time delay between pairs of microphones, enabling the determination of the sound source's location. 
- Sound Localization: Using the computed time delays, the system triangulates the 2D coordinates of the sound source within the A1 grid. 
- Wireless Communication: The Raspberry Pis communicate with each other wirelessly, allowing for efficient data transfer and synchronization.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI provides real-time visualization of the detected sound source's position on a digital grid representation. 

## 📈 Results
Through extensive simulations and real-world testing, the acoustic signal triangulation system has demonstrated impressive accuracy and precision in localizing sound sources. Here are some key results:
- Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) Computation: The system achieved an average accuracy of 96.55% in calculating the time delays between microphone pairs, with a standard deviation of 3.33 microseconds. 
- Sound Localization: The calculated sound positions had an average accuracy of 96.25% compared to the actual positions, with an average error of 20.74 millimeters. 
- Real-Time Performance: The system exhibited real-time capabilities, with processing times below 2 seconds for time delay computation and sound localization.
